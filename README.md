Fork of All the Ores 1.18 with (most) 1.19 features backported.

# THIS BREAKS ALL EXISTING WORLDS.

## DO NOT USE THIS ON WORLDS GENERATED WITH ANY OLDER VERSION OF ALL THE ORES.

***

~~Note that, unlike with the 1.19 version, user configs and worldgen remain implemented.~~  
(1.19 has worldgen, but ATO 1.19 uses 1.19-specific Forge data tags to modify biome generation to inject its own ores)
